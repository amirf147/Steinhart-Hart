# Steinhart-Hart
C program that uses the steinhart-Hart equation to determine temperature of thermistor from ADC value.

For eductational and verification purposes every step towards deriving and implementing the formula is outlined in the code up to and including the derivation of the A,B and C coefficients.

The resistor value connected to the thermistor can be changed in the code to match a different configuration.

The 3 temperatures and ADC values used to derive the formula can also be changed to fit the values for a different NTC thermistor.
